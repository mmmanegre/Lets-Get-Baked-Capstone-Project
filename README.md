This project is a baking recipe recommendation app made for people who want to find new baking recipes. It will have features such as filtering though search, preferences, serving size scaling, and grocery list creation. 

So far, we have created a database of 4 recipes to start with created on supabase. a demo website using html and css created on this git repo that has a log in page, profile page,home page, and a recipes page. Our Jira board has been fully configured with our user stories. Our current git repository has two branches, the main branch and the development branch.
