Project Title: Lets Get Baked
Team Name/Number: Group 1
Sprint Number: 1
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Team Members and Roles:
Project Lead: Kaylee Broadfield
Developer Lead: Michelle Manegre
Documentation Lead: Ellie Mawuenyega


1. Sprint Overview
Objective:
This project is a baking recipe recommendation app made for people who want to find new baking recipes. It will have features such as filtering though search, preferences, serving size scaling, and grocery list creation. 
The main goal of this sprint is to have a working website skeleton, a functioning database, and our jira board properly updated with our user stories. 


2. Work Completed
So far, we have created a database of 4 recipes to start with created with PostgreSQL via supabase, a demo website using html and css created on this git repo that has a log in page, profile page,home page, and a recipes page. Our Jira board has been fully configured with our user stories. Our current git repository has two branches, the main branch and the development branch. 




3. Tools and Technologies Used
List key tools, frameworks, or platforms used: (e.g., GitHub, Jira, Python, React, MySQL, etc.)
Supabase is a free hosted backend service tool that allows us to query our PostgreSQL database via an auto-generated API to avoid maintaining a server file in python, which will result in better security and faster deployment.

4. Challenges and Solutions
Briefly describe issues faced and how they were addressed:
Challenge: Our first challenge was creating a working front end and backend of our webpage on github
Solution: We were able to get our html and javascript up and working by making sure to connect them inside the html files and using GitHub Pages to deploy our website skeleton. Pages was a bit finicky because we put our frontend and backend files folders, but when we removed them and made sure git could clearly see index.html it worked.
Challenge: Our second challenge was getting a connection to Supabase(PostgreSQL) from our website via javascript and API calls.
Solution: We were able to use the console log to help debug and get our connection code correct and working.
Challenge: Our third challenge was querying the database in order to successfully have a user log in, sign up, and search for recipes.          Solution: We utilized javascript tools to update our script.js file with functions that query the database and insert data into the database. We utilized console logging messages along the way in order to debug in scenarios where our data wasn’t outputting correctly. We also added error handling and alerts to handle scenarios where the user might not follow the ‘correct’ approach (ex. Enter the wrong username/password).

5. Reflection and Learning
Summarize what the team learned or improved during this sprint:
	The team has learned how to interact with jira and supabase and combine the data into Git. We’ve improved upon using the git repo in a joint manner for project work instead of typical the solo assignment work that we have done previously. 


6. Plans for Next Sprint
State upcoming goals or focus areas for the next sprint:
Our plans for the next sprint include: getting the website backend database design further developed so that we can start simulating user recipe searches
